Payment Calculator is a loan amortization calculator made with C#.Net and WPF on .Net Core 3.0.

To run, download the latest [release](https://github.com/void-type/Payment_Calculator_WPF/releases) and run the PaymentCalculator.exe executable.

Releases 2.0 and beyond require [.Net Core 3.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) to be installed.
Prior releases were built with .Net Framework 4.6.1 and should run on Windows 7 and up without any installs.

## Features

* Build an amortization schedule for loans and mortgages.
* See loan metrics like total interest paid and total paid over the lifetime of the loan.

This project uses the [VoidCore.Finance](https://github.com/void-type/VoidCore.Finance) library.

## Comments

This application has it's roots in Visual Basic class assignment I had in college. It was an amortization calculator written in VB.NET and WinForms.

I wanted to port that assignment to C#, but there wasn't a C# variant of the Microsoft.VisualBasic.Financial library, and .Net was not open source at the time.

So, I created this project. Within it, the beginnings of VoidCore.Financial took shape via reverse-engineering the financial functions in VB.NET and Excel. I ran into some errata in the VB implementation when I was first developing the library. I believe I worked around them by using decimal types and using some improved logic, so my implementation will not be a perfect emulation.

I can't guarantee it will be bug-free, but there are some unit tests for common use-cases.

## Developers

To work on Payment Calculator, you will need the [.Net Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

You will also need some global tools. To install them easily, just run the following:

```powershell
cd build/
./installAndUpdateTools.ps1
```

See the /build folder for scripts used to test and build this project.

There are [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) tasks for each script. The build task (ctrl + shift + b) performs the standard CI build.
